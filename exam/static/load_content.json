Similarly, I also want to travel to European tourist spots because of how captivated I am by their architecture. In addition, I want to also see the Norther Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, because I believe it is the closest thing to magic we can have in this world. Lastly, I want to conquer my thalassophobia, which is a fear of deep bodies of water. Although, I have yet to decide how to go about it in practice",
